# cache-impls: sample cache implementations
Bart Massey 2021

These implementations need to be finished up. When they are,
they will provide two toy caching policies and two
"realistic" ones.

I would suggest fixing these in the order: `null`,
`non-evicting`, `lru`, `rr`.

Bonus points (whatever that means) for writing an `lfu`
("Least-Frequently Used") crate.
